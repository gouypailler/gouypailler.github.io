Shortly after saving the file, your site will automatically update Read the Quick Start Guide to learn how to add Markdown content. For inspiration, refer to the Markdown content which powers the Demo  Install with Git Prerequisites:\n Download and install Git Download and install Hugo   Fork the Academic Kickstart repository and clone your fork with Git:\ngit clone https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart.git My_Website  Note that if you forked Academic Kickstart, the above command should be edited to clone your fork, i.e. replace sourcethemes with your GitHub username.\n Initialize the theme:\ncd My_Website git submodule update --init --recursive   Install with ZIP  Download and extract Academic Kickstart Download and extract the Academic theme to the themes/academic/ folder from the above step  Install with RStudio View the guide to installing Academic with RStudio\nQuick start  If you installed on your computer, view your new website by running the following command:\nhugo server  Now visit localhost:1313 and your new Academic powered website will appear. Otherwise, if using Netlify, they will provide you with your URL.\n Read the Quick Start Guide to learn how to add Markdown content, customize your site, and deploy it. For inspiration, refer to the Markdown content which powers the Demo\n Build your site by running the hugo command. Then host it for free using Github Pages or Netlify (refer to the first installation method). Alternatively, copy the generated public/ directory (by FTP, Rsync, etc.) to your production web server (such as a university\u0026rsquo;s hosting service).\n  Updating Feel free to star the project on Github to help keep track of updates and check out the release notes prior to updating your site.\nBefore updating the framework, it is recommended to make a backup of your entire website directory (or at least your themes/academic directory) and record your current version number.\nBy default, Academic is installed as a Git submodule which can be updated by running the following command:\ngit submodule update --remote --merge  Check out the update guide for full instructions and alternative methods.\nFeedback \u0026amp; Contributing Please use the issue tracker to let me know about any bugs or feature requests, or alternatively make a pull request.\nFor support, head over to the Hugo discussion forum.\nLicense Copyright 2016-present George Cushen.\nReleased under the MIT license.\n","date":1461103200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1515798000,"objectID":"ba6423d815d4f5949b7a69912feb741d","permalink":"/post/getting-started/","publishdate":"2016-04-20T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/getting-started/","section":"post","summary":"Create a beautifully simple website or blog in under 10 minutes.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Academic: the website designer for Hugo","type":"post"},{"authors":["Flore Harle","Florent Chatelain","Cedric Gouy-Pailler","Sophie Achard"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"e04527872ae73693310c4b7c9b935436","permalink":"/publication/2016-01-01_harlcga16/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016-01-01_harlcga16/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper addresses the issue of detecting change-points in time series. The proposed model, called the Bernoulli Detector, is presented first in a univariate context. This approach differs from existing counterparts by making only assumptions on the nature of the change-points, and does not depend on hypothesis on the distribution of the data, contrary to the parametric methods. It relies on the combination of a local robust statistical test, based on the computation of ranks and acting on individual time segments, with a global Bayesian framework able to optimize the change-points configurations from multiple local statistics, provided as $p$-values. The control of the detection of a single change-point is proved even for small samples. The interest of such a generalizable nonparametric approach is shown on simulated data by the good performances attained for Gaussian noise as well as in presence of outliers, without adapting the model. The model is extended to the multivariate case by introducing the probabilities that the change-points affect simultaneously several time series. The method presents then the advantage to detect both unique and shared change-points for each signal. We finally illustrate our algorithm with real datasets from energy monitoring and genomic. Segmentations are compared to state-of-the-art approaches like the group lasso and the BARD algorithm.","tags":[],"title":"Bayesian Model for Multiple Change-Points Detection in Multivariate Time Series","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Summary\n","date":1451602800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451602800,"objectID":"568623d6f4f12236db35047b88cb26b6","permalink":"/project/diffprivml/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/diffprivml/","section":"project","summary":"Rafaël Pinot's PhD thesis.","tags":["securML"],"title":"Differential privacy in Machine Learning applications","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Summary\n","date":1451602800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451602800,"objectID":"e3f4c09595d260a1df426743ae833eca","permalink":"/project/sketching4ml/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/sketching4ml/","section":"project","summary":"Anne Morvan's PhD thesis.","tags":["streaming"],"title":"Sketching for Machine Learning","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":"R Markdown\rThis is an R Markdown document.
